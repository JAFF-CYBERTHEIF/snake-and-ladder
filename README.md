# snake-and-ladder
the simplest snake and ladder implementation. (python)(interview preperation)
this python code is only a implementation of the idea. it doesn't have a GUI
begginer friendly 
declared variables:
 1.p1 for player one counter
 2.p2 for player two counter 
 3.board for data about board. it is a list containing 26 elements which represents the weight of every blocks in the board. negative values represents snake and positive value representes ladder (you can edit)
 4.dice to store the value of dice(I used a single dice 1-6)
 how to play the game?
 there should be two players.
 type roll and press enter key at your turn 
 dice will be rolled and your couter will be moved to the respective position 
 the steps will be printed 
 eg:
type 'roll' and enter to roll the dice :roll
player 1 turn
DICE:  2
2  is the psition of player1
